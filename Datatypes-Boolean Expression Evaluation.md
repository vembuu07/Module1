# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

Step 1: Input
Read string a from the user.

Read string b from the user.

Step 2: Comparison
Use the == operator to check whether both strings are exactly the same (including case, whitespace, etc.).

Step 3: Output
Print True if a is equal to b, else print False.

## ðŸ’» Program
``` python
a=(input())
b=(input())
print((a == b))
```

## Output

## Result

Thus the python program to print the boolean value is executed successfully.
